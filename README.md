# **Pokemon | Text-Based-Game**

This Pokemon game has the same mechanics as the old Pokemon game which we all had played as some point. But still if you haven't played the old game, it's fine evne I hadn't played it. Although I have created this game through my sources and also the huge contributor and by the mentorship given by Outscal, I was able to create this masterpiece.

To play this game, you'll just have to copy this "./Pokemon" and paste it to the terminal below. Or if you can type if, that's also fine. After that you'll be able to understand the game pretty well because Professor Oak will be there to guide you.
